/*
 * TODO:
 * When you die, you get a screen that pops up that says how long you lived for along with hichscore/enemies killed?
 * death effects, cool death animations/ particle effects
 * background image with borders which is where the colliders/border should be 
 * enemies that take multiple hits to kill
 * main menu where you can pick controls and start playing, disable music/sounds
 * keep high scores online from all players
 * better fonts
 * better button graphics
 * enemies with different kinds of movement, say hopping from place to place or just something different from what I have now
 * scooplike weapon that can be used to scoop away lava slime remains
 * 
 * 
 */

/*
 * DONE:
 * win after destroying all enemies: check dynamically for all the spawners, when all are gone and no tagged enemies are left, you win that level
 * enemies that shoot out stuff a la bullethell - this can still be expanded on with more enemies
 * allow player to pick level to play on
 * allow player to pick weapon from unlocked weapons
 * stuff that lingers on the ground for a bit
 * Make you get new weapons after a while - maybe they should spawn on the ground and you can pick them up by moving on top of them
 * Make the sword rotate towards the mouse position instead of last walked direction
 * Make new enemies that spawn after a while
