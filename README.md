### Play the game in your browser here: https://wesslo.itch.io/slayer (For some users chrome is really laggy - if that happens I suggest firefox or edge)

Repository for a melee bullet-hell-ish game I made with Unity 2020.2.1f1. Inspired partly by an old flash game that I cannot find anymore, but involved various types of slimes coming onto the screen over time, leaving behind various dangerous objects on the ground as they died. 

Gameplay involves clearing levels by slaying all the enemies that appear on screen. You have one life, so if you die (by touching an enemy or projectile), you have to try the level again. After each level you'll get a new weapon. Weapon kinds range from electroshock tridents that shoot out lightning, to swift shurikens, to shovels that can remove area hazards from the ground. 

Currently the main reason for this repository is to sync my progress between my two workstations. ~~and to boost my commit history haha~~
