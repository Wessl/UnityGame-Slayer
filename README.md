[WIP] Repository for a melee bullet-hell-ish game I'm making with Unity 2020.2.1f1. Inspired partly by an old flash game that I cannot find anymore, but involved various types of slimes coming onto the screen over time, leaving behind various dangerous objects on the ground as they died. 

Currently the main reason for this repository is to sync my progress between my two workstations. ~~and to boost my commit history haha~~
